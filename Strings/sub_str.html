<!-- 
    
    JavaScript String substr()
substr() is similar to slice().

1) The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.


2) The difference is that start and end values less than 0 are treated as 0 in substring().

3) If the first parameter is negative, the position counts from the end of the string.

Note
JavaScript counts positions from zero.

First position is 0.

Second position is 1.

<p>The substr() method extract a part of a string
and returns the extracted parts in a new string:</p>

<p id="third"></p>

<script>
let str = "Apple, Banana,Kiwi";
document.getElementById("third").innerHTML = str.substr(7,11);
//start slicing from the start index and the second argument is the total length from their(start_index, total_length from their)
